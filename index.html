        <h3>Hello, I'm William Strohe</h3>
        <img src="images/japan.jpeg" alt="This is a photo of me sitting in a rose garden in Japan" width="500" />
        <p>I am a future software engineer from New Orleans, Louisiana.</p>
        <p>In my time on this rock flying through space, I have worked in a lot of different fields like:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Construction</li>
          <li>Snowboard Instructor</li>
          <li>Bartender</li>
          <li>Restaurant Manager</li>
          <li>Screen Printer</li>
        </ul>
        <p>You can say I'm kind of a "Jack of all Trades".</p>

        <h3>About Me</h3>
        <p>I grew up in south Louisiana in a small Cajun town. I have two sisters, and I am a very new uncle. I went to college for two years before I ended up moving to Colorado. I saw snow for the first time and couldn't get enough of it. After two years of living in the mountains, I started to really miss home, especially the food. So I moved back to New Orleans and have been here ever since. Along that time, I have been coast to coast and almost every national park in between.</p>
        <p>I am very much a people person and love to work with others. I've been with teams in multiple very different situations. Also, I've had to manage multiple businesses in which I loved my employees. My love for coding comes from so many different areasâ€”from apps, movies, to video games. The more I learn, the more respect I have for those who did this before me. And I can't wait to see what life has in store on the journey.</p>
