        <h3>About Me</h3>
        <p>I grew up in south Louisiana in very much a small cajun town.  I have two sisters and I am a very new uncle.  I went to college for two years before I ended up moving to Colorado.  I saw snow for the first time and couldn't get enough of it.  After two years of living in the mountians I started to really miss home, especially the food.  So I moved back to New Orleans and have been here ever since.  Along that time I have been coast to coast and alomost every national park in between.</p>
        <p>I am very much a people person and love to work with others.  I've been with teams in multiple very different situations. Also I've had to manage multiple business in which I loved my employees.  My love from coding comes from so many different areas from apps, movies, to video games.  The more I learn the more respect I have for those who did this before me.  And I can't wait to see what life has instore on the journey.</p>
